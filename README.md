# JasonTicketScanner

This is a general admission (multiple) ticket scanner application.

This is a quick thrown-together application built for one event,
and it may require some changes to deploy in a real world situation.

* To run this application, run `mvn clean javafx:run`
* To build this application, run `mvn clean javafx:jlink`, then `./target/app/bin/app` to run
